          Dear Students and Parents, <br />
          Welcome to BGSCET MBA, where we believe that an MBA is not just a degree—it is a transformation. Our program, affiliated with Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), is built to equip students with the mindset, tools, and network to lead in today’s dynamic and data-driven economy. <br/>
          At BGSCET MBA, we focus equally on academic excellence and real-world readiness. Students spend around 60% of their time in classroom-based learning led by experienced faculty and domain experts. The remaining 40% is devoted to immersive experiences—industry internships, social impact volunteering, incubation projects, and intensive case-based discussions in our agile learning spaces. <br/>
          For AY 2025-26, we are proud to offer:
          <ul>
            <li>Two in-demand MBA tracks: General Management and Digital Marketing</li>
            <li>An AI-enabled campus that nurtures innovation and decision-making</li>
            <li>The Performance Enrichment and Excellence Program (PEEP) for continuous skills upgrading</li>
            <li>A vibrant Incubation Centre to support entrepreneurial ideas and startup ambitions</li>
          </ul>
          Our goal is simple: to make our students industry-ready and opportunity-ready. I warmly invite you to visit our campus, meet our community, and explore how the BGSCET MBA can accelerate your journey.
